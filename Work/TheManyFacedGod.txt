#Nyarlathotep, the Many-Faced God

In researching the [Lovecraft (Cthulhu) Mythos][Mythos] for the inspirations of the terrible [Gods of Terros][Terror], one name keeps popping up as a central agent of chaos, who appears on Earth to perform the bidding of the [Great Old Ones][Old]: the Crawling Chaos, he of a thousand faces: [Nyarlathotep.][Nyar]

##Nyarlathotep Background


Nyarlathotep takes many forms. His true form is horrifying to humans, but he is most frequently encountered as a tall, swarthy man who takes joy in spreading chaos and suffering. In early stories he was encountered as an Egyptian pharoah-like being, who inspires legions of followers with demonstrations of magical and terrible new technologies. 
Through rich rewards and magical deception, these followers lose awareness of their surroundings as Nyarlathotep, ambassador of the banished Outer Gods, bespeaks the end of the world.

# My Conclusions:

Euron is no longer the brother of Aeron and Balon. He has been taken over by the Crawling Chaos, the god of a thousand faces, the rat in the wall, the tall, swarthy pharaoh-like man who brings chaos and wins legions of followers through demonstrations of terrible, magical technology. 

Euron has been taken over by [Nyarlathotep, the Lovecraftian god of terror][Nyar] who invokes on Earth the awful wishes of the sleeping and dreaming Great Old Ones. 

Nyarlathotep, the Faceless God, he of a thousand terrible forms, has been present throughout the stories in many forms - all representing death and despair.

When the Ghost of High Heart sees a man without a face on a bridge, with a crow on his shoulder, she's not describing a Faceless Man.

She is describing The Faceless Man, Nyarlathotep, who has become Euron. And its through Euron that Nyarlathotep will fulfill his role of harbinger of doom, and awaken the sleeping Great Old Ones.
