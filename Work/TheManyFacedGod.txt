#Nyarlathotep, the Many-Faced God

In researching the [Lovecraft (Cthulhu) Mythos][Mythos] for the inspirations of the terrible [Gods of Terros][Terror], one name keeps popping up as a central agent of chaos, who appears on Earth to perform the bidding of the [Outer Gods][Old]:  the Outer God know as [Nyarlathotep][Nyar].

Nyarlathotep. The Crawling Chaos, the Faceless God, the Sphinx, the Haunter of the Dark. Who is this mysterious Outer God? Why is he central to the plans of the Outer Gods, whom he openly mocks? Why does he enjoy spreading fear, chaos and terror in the hearts of humans?


In this essay I will argue that the Many-Faced God of the House of Black and White of Braavos is none other than Nyarlathotep. To further the whim of the Outer Gods, who have been banished from Earth, the Faceless God Nyarlathotep roams the world in many forms. His evil aims will become central to the main story of A Song of Ice and Fire in *The Winds of Winter*, as his one of his avatars mocks both the Gods and humans and bespeaks the end of the world by hastening the return of the [Outer Gods][Ones] and the Great Old Ones.




##Nyarlathotep Background

>"Nyarlathotep, horror of infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the Other Gods" - HP Lovecraft, ["The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath"][Kadath]

Developed by HP Lovecraft in 1920, Nyarlathotep is first decribed as man of strange powers who has come from the ancient lands of Eygpt. He gives demonstrations of his strange powers that awe and frighten the people, but his reputation spreads qiuckly, as do the night screams and nightmares of the populace in the lands he visits.

HP Lovecraft wrote 4 stories and one poem where an avatar of Nyarlathotep appears directly: ["Nyarlathotep"][Prose],  ["The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath"][Kadath], ["The Dreams of the Witch House"][Witch], ["The Haunter of the Dark"][Haunter] and the poem ["Fungi from Yuggoth"][Fungi], where he appears in 2 stanzas. 

Though relative to other gods, Nyarlathotep has a large percentage of Lovecraft's writings, as far as direct references we see him appear in 5 different forms: 

 + a tall and swarthy man who resembles a Pharaoh, who hails from Egypt and gives presentations of strange and powerful instruments while spreading fear and discord among the populace.
 + a demon with skin as black as night.
 + a dreamy, god-like pharoah.
 + a tall and swarthy man who resembles a Pharaoh, who hails from Egypt and gives presentations of strange and powerful instruments while spreading fear and discord among the populace.







Quickly adopted by the many other writers who shared the Cthulhu Mythos with Lovecraft (Block, Price, Derleth, Carter, and more), and even other authors who are not known as Mythos writers (such as Stephen King), the role and archetype of Nyarlathotep has been employed to introduce a mocking, malevolant being who takes many forms (or wears many masks, according to some of the Mythos writers) and has many avatars on Earth. 



##The God of the Thousand Forms

Nyarlathotep has a true form but this true form is horrifying to humans. He is most frequently encountered as a tall, swarthy man who takes joy in spreading chaos and suffering. In early stories he was encountered as an Egyptian pharoah-like being, who inspires legions of followers with demonstrations of magical and terrible new technologies. Through rich rewards and magical deception, these followers lose awareness of their surroundings as Nyarlathotep, ambassador of the banished Outer Gods, spreads despair and terror.

It's postulated that he has so many forms because of the many gods that he serves - that each of them, while banished from Earth, can take the form of Nyarlathotep and so the many roles he must play on Earth  can represent separate and even disparate missions. Let's review some of the Cthulhu Mythos forms and roles fulfilled by the many faces of Nyarlathotep.



###The Faceless God

>It was the eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth's centre where Nyarlathotep, **the mad faceless god**, howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players.
- HP Lovecraft, ["The Rats in the Walls"][Rats]

Here is the earliest and most direct reference to the Faceless God by Lovecraft himself. Lovecraft had developed the character of Nyarlathotep from the initial mysterious man from Eygpt into a god, and encouraged other writers to do so as well.

###The Crawling Chaos

Another name or title of Nyarlathotep is The Crawling Chaos.

Nyarlathotep takes great pride in driving men mad and causing chaos, instead of just torturing people, he aims to drive them mad.

>Unlike the other Outer Gods, spreading madness is more important and enjoyable than death and destruction to [Nyarlathotep.][Nyar]

###The Haunter of the Dark

This is really interesting, as it relates directly to the Church of Starry Wisdom, which exists in Westeros and Essos and has a sinister reputation, according to Master Yandel. In "The Haunter of the Dark", written by Lovecraft in 1935, the diaries of the *Spoiler* (dead) protagonist are discussed and analyzed for truth. Robert Blake, the protagonist, is a writer in Providence, Rhode Island. He described his facination with a dark church: 

>"Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky." - HP Lovecraft, ["The Haunter of the Dark"][Haunter]

He becomes obsessed withthe church and its dark presence. He decides to investigate it finally and what he finds horrifies him:

>It was a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time. The clothing was in shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man's grey suit.

A note in the man's tattered pocket contained a sordid history of the presence of the Church of Starry Wisdom in the town. It describes how its cultists use an ancient Egyptian "box" that "can't exist in light", and that these cultists used this "box", which they called the [Shining Trapezohedron][[Shining], as a window to see all of space and time. 
This window, and the knowledge that could be gained by looking into it, came at a terrible price. For Nyarlathotep, in his avatar The Haunter of the Dark, demanded monsterous sacrifices for the use of the Shining Trapezohedron.


###What form does this avatar take? **A three-lobed burning eye with wings.**

[Does that remind you of anyone's sigil, just a little?][Sigil] (Euron. It's Euron.)

###The Black Man of the Witch Cult

In *The Dreams in the Witch House*, by Lovecraft, by sleeping in a haunted Salem attic where a witch disappeared long before, the protagonist meets the Black Man of the Witch Cult. This is not a man of recent African descent; instead, he has midnight black skin, hairless and wearing a black robe. He represents the collusion of the witches with an evil worthy of Satan, or even Nyarlathotep



###Nephren-Ka

>"The Black Pharaoh, an insane pharaoh who secured the Shining Trapezohedron for Egypt, but after being convinced by the resident Haunter of the Dark, he had a lightless temple created to hold the stone and the deity within. That temple became a center of abominable happenings, and the rites carried out there were so monstrous the temple was destroyed and the Pharaoh's name was struck from all records and monuments. The Pharaoh was controlled by the cruel god Nyarlathotep, of whom [the Haunter of the Dark was likely an avatar"][Nephren]



###The Sphinx

Nyarlathotep is known as the Sphinx, and loves to tease humans with riddles, much like the mythical Sphinx of ancient Egyptian lore. Having been created by Lovecraft with a psuedo-Egyptian name ("-thotep" being an Egyptian honorific meaning "honored"), the reference to the mysterious Sphinx, also without a face, was unavoidable.

One story concerning Nyarlathotep is called "The Faceless God". Written by Robert Bloch in 1933, this avatar of Nyarlathotep took the form of a faceless sphinx idol, buried in the Egyptian desert and uncovered by a ruthless archaeologist. The idol, made of a curious black stone, inspires great fear in the native Egpytians hired to uncover and haul the idol. They desert the corrupt archaeologist to his doom that very night, and the sphinx comes alive to hunt him down.


###The Dweller in Darkness

In this August Derleth story, a professor studying a haunted lake in Wisconsin disappears and his friend sets out to find him. What he discovers is that the lake and the woods are inhabited by an avatar of Nyarlathotep. To drive him away, the friend is helped by a sullen local Native American who is haunted by the long history of the lake and the terrible Great Old One.

This is also a notable story as it both introduces Derleth's major addition to the Mythos, [Cthugha][Fire], and sees Cthugha invoked to scare away the avatar of Nyarlathotep. From the beginnning, then, Cthugha, the Lord of Light, is at war with Nylarlathotep. 

###The Rat in the Walls

###The Whisperer in the Darkness


###Yhoundeh, the Wife of Nyarlathotep

I'm not sure exactly how this fits in yet, but I know that Nyarlathotep has a wife, the horned elk-goddess Yhoundeh. She was worshiped in ancient times in Hyperboria after her priests banned the worship of Tsathoggua. However, the fall of the Hyperborean civilization lead to the abandonment of the religon of Yhoundeh.

She is mainly mentioned in the [The Door to Saturn][Door] by Derleth

Apparently, Yhoundeh had an affair with Darkness, which birthed Shug-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. The Black Goat is worshiped in Qohor


##Randall Flagg (Stephen King)

Stephen King, long inspired by the Mythos, used the Nyarlathotep archetype to introduce Randall Flagg. In fact, the language describing Randall Flagg is very similar to the language HP Lovecraft uses to introduce Nyarlathotep. Compare these two passages:

>There was a dark hilarity in his face, and perhaps in his heart, too, you would think � and you would be right. It was the face of a hatefully happy man, a face that radiated a horrible handsome warmth, a face to make water glasses shatter in the hands of tired truck-stop waitresses, to make small children crash their trikes into board fences and then run wailing to their mommies with stake-shaped splinters sticking out of their knees. It was a face guaranteed to make barroom arguments over batting averages turn bloody.
-Stephen King, *The Stand*



>And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the sciences � of electricity and psychology �and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished; for the small hours were rent with the screams of a nightmare. -H.P. Lovecraft, ["Nyarlathotep"][Nyar]

>Then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode; a tall, slim figure with the young face of an antique Pharaoh, gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent light. Close up to Carter strode that regal figure; whose proud carriage and swart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen archangel, and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour. It spoke, and in its mellow tones there rippled the mild music of Lethean streams. -H.P. Lovecraft, ["The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"][Nyar]



With two very different styles, both King and Lovecraft invoke a man who radiates power and evil, who inspires nightmares and terror wherever he goes.

Technically, in universe, he is referred to as "Nyarlahotep", but this is referencing the same character, a man-like being who serves terrible gods but does so mockingly, while tricking humans into following him with "strange instruments of glass and metal" and "exhibitions of power which sent his followers away speechless".



##What are the many roles of Nyarlathotep in the Mythos?

###Role as The Messenger of the Gods

>"And through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond Time; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate gods�the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is Nyarlathotep." HP Lovecraft, ["Nyarlathotep"][Prose]

>"... the gigantic ultimate gods, the blind, voiceless, tenebrous, mindless Other Gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep." - HP Lovecraft, ["The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath"][Kadath]


Because Nyarlathotep can walk among mortals, Lovecraft and the other Mythos writers employ Nyarlathotep as the interface between humans and the Outer Gods. 



###Bringer of Chaos



###Teller of Lies

Nyarlathotep spreads not just doom but lies as well, to help spread fear and distress within the populace. In the first story, HP Lovecraft describes how screams and nightmares filled each city visited by Nyarlathotep as he gave his demonstrations of power.

###Harbinger of Doom


#Nyarlathotep in A Song of Ice and Fire

##Dawn of Time

###The Bloodstone Emperor?



##The Many-Faced God and the representations of Death

This connection is at the heart of the relationship between Nyarlathotep and mortals. In fact, it is the main role that Nyarlathotep takes in A Song of Ice and Fire: that of the God of Death. From the beginning, the roots of the cult of the Faceless Men is about Death.

The story told by the Kindly Man to Arya about the beginnings of the cult of the Many-Faced God in the House of Black and White indicates that The Many-Faced God gave the first "gift" of death to a slave. But before he gave the gift, he trained this first Faceless Man in the ways of the masks.

But not every god represented in the House of Black and White is directly associated with the Cthulhu Mythos.


###The Faceless Men

In the Cthulhu Mythos there is a group of cultists called the [Dark Brotherhood or Black Brotherhood][Black], who are dedicated to hastening the return of the Great Old Ones. They are an international group of assasins, made of people of all ethnicities and all ways of life, who adopt a mask to disguise themselves.

Now, this being an August Derleth story (while it's credited to both him and Lovecraft, it's his story from HP's rough idea), all of the assasins wear a mask that stupidly looks like Edgar Allen Poe. Yes, the writer. It's also worth noting that Poe wrote a story called the Sphinx which may have influenced Nyarlathotep's background. 

These 

>"It is understood in the land of dream that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men; and all these agents, whether wholly human or slightly less than human, are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep."

###The Stranger

###The Black Goat?

The association of the Black Goat with the Many-Faced God at the House of Black and White is a bit confusing, as Shub-Niggurath is seen as female, and the Black Goat is seen as male in the World of Ice and Fire.

However, this confusion is usually resolved by picturing this Black Goat (of a Thousand Young), a Pan-like satyr or half-man/half-goat, as the incarnation of Shub-Niggurath on Earth. This horned Lord of the Woods copulates with worshippers to produce horrible offspring. And he demands blood sacrifices from beasts and man alike.

The Black Goat, then, may not be one of Nyarlathotep's forms, but he is definitely a god of Death and is one of the avatars of an Outer God.


###Lion of Night

Because the Many-Faced God is directly associated with the Lion of Night, and Nyarlathotep is associated with the Many-Faced God, then Nyarlathotep may be directly associated with the coming of the Long Night as described in The World of Ice and Fire.


##Littlefinger?

The emphasis on causing chaos, and his background in Braavos where they worship the Many-Faced God among other gods, makes me suspect that  Petyr Baelish might be some form of Nyarlathotep, but in the end I don't think he fits the archetype. He's just a scheming man (though no ordinary schemer, to be sure), and not a god intent on the destruction of humanity.

However, I do wonder exactly which gods Varys is referencing in [this quote from Arya III][Arya]:

>"This is no longer a game for two players, if it ever was. Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them. The Knight of Flowers write Highgardeb, urging his lord father to send his sister tocourt. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and make her a new queen. Litlefinger ... **the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing**"

Given that it hasn't been established exactly which gods Varys prays to, and the fact that he is talking privately (he thinks) to Illyrio, this should not just be taken as a reference to the Seven. Is it a reference to the [Outer Gods][Ones]?




##Moroqqo

This is my choice for a second avatar of Nyarlathotep. His description is very close to the Dark Man or Black Man of the Witch Cults version of Nyarlathotep. His skin is not brown or tan, but is instead coal black, as black as night:



When he joins Victarion, the crew is incredibly afraid of him, much like the natives of Eygpt who fear the black stone Sphinx from "The Dweller In Darkness". He is not the same man that Tyrion encountered on the Selasori 

##Euron Greyjoy

Who in the story is the seed of evil, the spreader of chaos and lies, who tricks men into following him to their doom using strange instruments of glass and metal? Who sees himself as both better than humans and the gods, but at the same time  is performing the will of the gods using blood rituals?

It's Euron. He has returned from his banishment, but he is not fully human anymore, if he ever was. And he is here to torture, to kill, to drive men mad, as we see when he is alone with Aeron in The Winds of Winter sample chapter. Wearing a suit of Valyrian armor, he

>That is not dead which can eternal lie, [And with strange aeons even death may die.][Call]

Euron makes blood sacrifices to the Storm God ([who I believe to be Hastur][Magnum]


#My Conclusions:

Nyarlathotep, the Faceless God, he of a thousand terrible forms, has been present throughout the stories in many forms - all representing death and despair.

When the Ghost of High Heart sees a man without a face on a bridge, with a crow on his shoulder, she's not describing a Faceless Man.

She is describing The Faceless Man, Nyarlathotep, who has become Euron. And its through Euron that Nyarlathotep will fulfill his role of harbinger of doom, and awaken the sleeping Outer Gods. While Euron denies his direct involvement in "The Forsaken", Nyarlathotep, in one of his forms, was responsible.


##Euron Greyjoy

>"Who knows more of gods than I? Horse gods and fire gods, gods made of gold with gemstone eyes, gods carved of cedar wood, gods chiseled into mountains, gods of empty air... I know them all. I have seen their peoples garland them with flowers, and shed the blood of goats and bulls and children in their names. And I have heard the prayers, in half a hundred tongues. Cure my withered leg, make the maiden love me, grant me a healthy son. Save me, succor me, make me wealthy... protect me! Protect me from mine enemies, protect me from the darkness, protect me from the crabs inside my belly, from the horselords, from the slavers, from the sellswords at my door. Protect me from the Silence." He laughed. "Godless? Why, Aeron, I am the godliest man ever to raise sail! You serve one god, Damphair, but I have served ten thousand. From Ib to Asshai, when men see my sails, they pray."  - George RR Martin, *A Feast For Crows*

Euron is no longer the brother of Aeron and Balon. He has been taken over by the Crawling Chaos, the god of a thousand faces, the tall, swarthy pharaoh-like man who brings chaos and wins legions of followers through demonstrations of terrible, magical technology. And it is Euron, who serves the Gods, who will awaken them from their slumber.
