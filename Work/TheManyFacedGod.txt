#Nyarlathotep, the Many-Faced God

In researching the [Lovecraft (Cthulhu) Mythos][Mythos] for the inspirations of the terrible [Gods of Terros][Terror], one name keeps popping up as a central agent of chaos, who appears on Earth to perform the bidding of the [Outer Gods][Old]: the Crawling Chaos, he of a thousand faces, the Outer God know as [Nyarlathotep.][Nyar] Who is this mysterious Outer God? Why is he central to the plans of the Outer Gods, whom he openly mocks? Why does he enjoy spreading fear, chaos and terror in the hearts of humans?


In this essay I will argue that the Many-Faced God of the House of Black and White of Braavos is none other than Nyarlathotep. To further the whim of the Outer Gods, who have been banished from Earth, the Faceless God Nyarlathotep roams the world in many forms. His evil aims will become central to the main story of A Song of Ice and Fire in The Winds of Winter, as his one of his avatars mocks both the Gods and humans and bespeaks the end of the world by hastening the return of the [Outer Gods][Ones].

##Nyarlathotep Background

Developed by HP Lovecraft in 1920, Nyarlathotep is first decribed as man of strange powers who has come from the ancient lands of Eygpt. He gives demonstrations of his strange powers that awe and frighten the people, but his reputation spreads qickly, as do the night screams and nightmares of the populace.

Quickly adopted by the many other writers who shared the Cthulhu Mythos with Lovecraft (Block, Price, Derleth, Carter, even Stephen King), the role and archetype of Nyarlathotep has been employed to introduce a mocking, malevolant god-like being who takes many forms and has many avatars on Earth. 

##The God of the Thousand Forms

Nyarlathotep has a true form but this true form is horrifying to humans. He is most frequently encountered as a tall, swarthy man who takes joy in spreading chaos and suffering. In early stories he was encountered as an Egyptian pharoah-like being, who inspires legions of followers with demonstrations of magical and terrible new technologies. Through rich rewards and magical deception, these followers lose awareness of their surroundings as Nyarlathotep, ambassador of the banished Outer Gods, spreads despair and terror.

It's postulated that he has so many forms because of the many gods that he serves, and the many roles he must play on Earth as their messenger. Let's review some of the forms and roles he fulfills in the Cthulhu Mythos.

###The Sphinx and the Faceless God

Nyarlathotep is known as the Sphinx, and loves to tease humans with riddles, much like the mythical Sphinx of ancient Egyptian lore. Having been created by Lovecraft with a psuedo-Egyptian name ("-thotep" being an Egyptian honorific meaning "honored"), the reference to the mysterious Sphinx, also without a face, was unavoidable. 



>It was the eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth’s centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players.
- HP Lovecraft, ["The Rats in the Walls"][Rats]

One story concerning Nyarlathotep is called *The Faceless God*. Written by Robert Bloch in 1933, this avatar of Nyarlathotep took the form of a faceless sphinx idol, buried in the Egyptian desert and uncovered by a rithless archaeologist. The idol, made of a curious black stone, inspires great fear in the native Egpytians hired to uncover and haul the idol. They desert the corrupt archaeologist to his doom that very night, and the sphinx comes alive to hunt him down.
  
###The Crawling Chaos

Another name or title of Nyarlathotep is The Crawling Chaos.

Nyarlathotep takes great pride in driving men mad and causing chaos, instead of just torturing people, he aims to drive them mad. 

>Unlike the other Outer Gods, spreading madness is more important and enjoyable than death and destruction to [Nyarlathotep.][Nyar]

###The Haunter of the Dark

This is really interesting, as it relates directly to the Church of Starry Wisdom, which has a somewhat sinister reputation in Westeros. In "The Haunter of the Dark", written by Lovecraft in 1935, the diaries of the *Spoiler* (dead) protagonist are discussed and analyzed for truth. Robert Blake, the protagonist, is a writer in Providence, Rhode Island. He described his facination with a dark church: 

>"Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky." - HP Lovecraft, ["The Haunter of the Dark"][Haunter]

He becomes obsessed withthe church and its dark presence. He decides to investigate it finally and what he finds horrifies him:

>It was a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time. The clothing was in shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man’s grey suit.

A note in the man's tattered pocket contained a sordid history of the presence of the Church of Starry Wisdom in the town. It describes how its cultists use an ancient Egyptian "box" that "can't exist in light", and that these cultists used this "box", which they called the [Shining Trapezohedron][[Shining], as a window to see all of space and time. 
This window, and the knowledge that could be gained by looking into it, came at a terrible price. For Nyarlathotep, in his avatar The Haunter of the Dark, demanded monsterous sacrifices for the use of the Shining Trapezohedron.


###What form does this avatar take? **A three-lobed burning eye with wings.**




###The Black Man of the Witch Cult

In *The Dreams in the Witch House*, by Lovecraft, by sleeping in a haunted Salem attic where a witch disappeared long before, the protagonist meets the Black Man of the Witch Cult. This is not a man of recent African descent; instead, he has midnight black skin, hairless and wearing a black robe.


###The Dweller in Darkness

In this August Derleth story, a professor studying a haunted lake in Wisconsin disappears and his friend sets out to find him. What he discovers is that the lake and the woods are inhabited by an avatar of Nyarlathotep. To drive him away, the friend is helped by a sullen local Native American who is haunted by the long history of the lake and the terrible Great Old One.

This is also a notable story as it both introduces Derleth's major addition to the Mythos, [Cthugha][Fire], and sees Cthugha invoked to scare away the avatar of Nyarlathotep. From the beginnning, then, Cthugha, the Lord of Light, is at war with Nylarlathotep. 

###The Rat in the Walls

###The Whisperer in the Darkness

###

##Yhoundeh, the Wife of Nyarlathotep

[The Door to Saturn][Door]


##What are the many roles of Nyarlathotep in the Mythos?

###Role as The Messenger of the Gods

###Bringer of Chaos



###Teller of Lies

Nyarlathotep spreads not just doom but lies as well, to help spread fear and distress within the populace. In the first story, HP Lovecraft describes how screams and nightmares filled each city visited by Nyarlathotep as he gave his demonstrations of power.

###Harbinger of Doom


#Nyarlathotep in A Song of Ice and Fire

##Dawn of Time

###The Bloodstone Emperor?



##The Many-Faced God and the representations of Death

The story told by the Kindly Man to Arya about the beginnings of the cult of the Many-Faced God in the House of Black and White. The 

###The Stranger

###The Black Goat?

The association of the Black Goat with the Many-Faced God at the House of Black and White is a bit confusing, as Shub-Niggurath is seen as female, and the Black Goat is seen as male in the World of Ice and Fire.

However, this confusion is usually resolved by picturing this Black Goat (of a Thousand Young), a Pan-like satyr or half-man/half-goat, as the incarnation of Shub-Niggurath on Earth. This horned Lord of the Woods copulates with worshippers to produce horrible offspring. And he demands blood sacrifices from beasts and man alike.

The Black Goat, then, may not be one of Nyarlathotep's forms, but he is definitely a god of Death and is one of the avatars of the Outer Gods.


###Lion of Night

Because the Many-Faced God is directly associated with the Lion of Night, and Nyarlathotep is associated with the Many-Faced God, then Nyarlathotep may


##Little Finger?

The emphasis on causing chaos, and his background in Braavos where they worship the Many-Faced God among other gods, makes me suspect that  Petyr Baelish might be some form of Nyarlathotep, but in the end I don't think he fits the archetype. He's just a scheming man (though no ordinary schemer, to be sure), and not a god intent on the destruction of humanity.

However, I do wonder exactly which gods Varys is referencing in [this quote from Arya III][Arya]:

>"This is no longer a game for two players, if it ever was. Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them. The Knight of Flowers write Highgardeb, urging his lord father to send his sister tocourt. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and make her a new queen. Litlefinger ... **the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing**"

Given that it hasn't been established exactly which gods Varys prays to, and the fact that he is talking privately (he thinks) to Illyrio, this should not just be taken as a reference to the Seven. Is it a reference to the [Outer Gods][Ones]? 


##Euron Greyjoy

Who in the story is the seed of evil, the spreader of chaos and lies, who tricks men into following him to their doom using strange instruments of glass and metal? Who sees himself as both better than humans and the gods, but is performing the will of the gods at the same time using blood rituals?

It's Euron. He has returned from his banishment, but he is not fully human anymore, if he ever was. And he is here to torture, to kill, to drive men mad, as we see when he is alone with Aeron in The Winds of Winter sample chapter.



##Moroqqo

This is my choice for a second avatar of Nyarlathotep. His description is very close to the Dark Man or Black Man of the Witch Cults version of Nyarlathotep, the Nephren-Ka 

hen he joins 

##Randall Flagg (Stephen King)

Stephen King also used the Nyarlathotep archetype to introduce Randall Flagg. In fact, the language describing Randall Flagg is very similar to the language HP Lovecraft uses to introduce Nyarlathotep. Compare these two passages:

>There was a dark hilarity in his face, and perhaps in his heart, too, you would think — and you would be right. It was the face of a hatefully happy man, a face that radiated a horrible handsome warmth, a face to make water glasses shatter in the hands of tired truck-stop waitresses, to make small children crash their trikes into board fences and then run wailing to their mommies with stake-shaped splinters sticking out of their knees. It was a face guaranteed to make barroom arguments over batting averages turn bloody.
-Stephen King, *The Stand*



>And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the sciences – of electricity and psychology –and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished; for the small hours were rent with the screams of a nightmare.
-H.P. Lovecraft, *Nyarlathotep*



Technically, in universe, he is referred to as "Nyarlahotep", but this is referencing the same being. The character, a man-like being who serves evil gods but does so mockingly, while tricking humans into following him with "strange instruments of glass and metal" and "exhibitions of power which sent his followers away speechless".

#My Conclusions:

Euron is no longer the brother of Aeron and Balon. He has been taken over by the Crawling Chaos, the god of a thousand faces, the rat in the wall, the tall, swarthy pharaoh-like man who brings chaos and wins legions of followers through demonstrations of terrible, magical technology. Euron has been taken over by [Nyarlathotep, the Lovecraftian god of terror][Nyar] who invokes on Earth the awful wishes of the sleeping and dreaming Outer Gods. 

Nyarlathotep, the Faceless God, he of a thousand terrible forms, has been present throughout the stories in many forms - all representing death and despair.

When the Ghost of High Heart sees a man without a face on a bridge, with a crow on his shoulder, she's not describing a Faceless Man.

She is describing The Faceless Man, Nyarlathotep, who has become Euron. And its through Euron that Nyarlathotep will fulfill his role of harbinger of doom, and awaken the sleeping Outer Gods. While Euron denies his direct involvement in "The Forsaken", Nyarlathotep, in one of his forms, was responsible.


##What does this mean?

Good question. I think that it highlights both the terrible doom that is about to befall Terros, and the nature of the gods involved in the coming Long Night. 

Nyarlathotep loves to drive men mad, using chaos and fear to destroy the minds of men.


Euron's treatment of the 4 warlocks is a perfect example of his ability to inflect madness. He kills one of them, to show that he meant business, and then chained them up and made them eat the dead warlock (and probaly themselves). In "The Forsaken", we see what's left of Pyat Pree: a man without legs, who has clearly been driven mad:  

>Last were two warlocks of the east, with flesh as white as mushrooms, and lips the purplish­-blue of a bad bruise, all so gaunt and starved that only skin and bones remained. One had lost his legs. The mutes hung him from a rafter. “Pree,” he cried as he swung back and forth. “Pree, Pree!”

But his ultimate goal is not just to drive men mad and to spread chaos and fear. He is the harbinger of doom, Death, the Lion of Night, here to remake the world again.
  

##Oldtown and the Hightowers

The first goal of Euron is the taking of Oldtown. I have long suspected that the Hightowers of oldtown, that ancient family that traces back to Uthar Hightower and Maris the Maid, were involved in worship of the Outer Gods. It should come as no surprise to learn that the Cthulhu Mythos diety 

I suspect something else. The Shining Trapezohedron, the black stone that fell from Earth used by the Bloodstone Emperor, might be in the Hightower. As seen in [The Haunter in the Dark][Dark], the Church of Starry Wisdom has the Shining Trapezohedron stored in the high tower of the creepy church.

##The Citadel

##Faceless Men and Braavos

In the Cthulhu Mythos there is a group of cultists called the [Dark Brotherhood or Black Brotherhood][Black], who are dedicated to hastening the return of the Great Old Ones. They are an international group of assasins, made of people of all ethnicities and all ways of life.

These 


##Religious War

The followers of the Lord of Light hate the followers of the Norvoshi religion and the Qohorik religion, and the feeling is mutual. While [I think that the Norvoshi worship Hastur, the Magnum Innonominandum or He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-named][Magnum], the Black Goat is Shub-NYoungrath, [The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young][Goat] (It's worth noting that in ["The Mound" by Lovecraft][Mound], Shub-Niggurath is described as the wife of the Not-To-Be-Named One, [who is Hastur.][Magnum])

It seems clear that the founders of Norvos and Qohor, while Valyrian, were not dragon-riding Valyrians. In Norvos, they stuck with Hastur, The Great Shepherd. In Qohor they switched to The Black Goat.


Importantly, the enmity between the followers of R'hllor and these other religions represent the greater war between the Gods of Terros. I don't say this lightly; I've devoted a ton of time over the last few years trying to understand what is really going on in Westeros and Essos and Sothoryos and Leng and beyond; this [Tumblr is the result][Terror]. But this was all building to this point: that these gods are not make-believe, but are instead powerful beings beyond the understanding of humans, that are at war with each other.

Instead, we see the war between Cthulhu and Hastur in the hatred of the Ironborn for the Storm God; and the battles at Storm's End between Durran Godsgrief and the Storm God. We see the death cult of the Many-Faced God arise in Valyria as Nyarlathotep battles Cthugha, which I believe resulted in the Doom of Valyria and will cover later.
