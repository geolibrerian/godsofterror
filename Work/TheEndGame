The awakening of the Deep Ones will be felt all over Westeros and Essos. Armies of the Deep will begin to invade the land.

The armies will take famously cursed Harrenhall, which is cursed because the Iron King Harren the Black had always intended it to be used to rule the land by the returning Deep Ones, his ancient ancestors. Harrenhall was never intended for humans, but for the terrible hybrid Deep Ones, to use to control the Riverlands and to invade the North. Its construction, incorporating weirwoods and their magic, was always intended as a beachhead for the return of armies of the deep. Only the magic of the Targaryens prevented its full exploitation.


The Children of the Forest and the Weirwood Network were key to stopping the invading Deep Ones in the Battle for the Dawn, which is barely remembered by humans. A weir is a small dam used to catch fish, and is also known as a fish wier. Sometimes, it is known as a fish garth. 

Garth the Green was the first man of the Riverlands, who brought fertility to the land and to the daughters of the local lords. He is a nature being, who may be the son of Nodens and Yhoundeh (The Elk-Goddess), an ancient goddess who is also the wife of Nyarlathotep. Born of the sea and the land, Garth chose to share his magic with the land.
