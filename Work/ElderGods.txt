Nyarlathotep

Finally, in "The Haunter of the Dark" (1936), the being of pure darkness dwelling, possessing a "three-lobed eye", in the steeple of the Starry Wisdom sect's church is identified as another form, or manifestation of, Nyarlathotep.

 The King in Yellow is a creation of Ambrose Bierce but has been written about by many authors since and was added to the Mythos pantheon. He is most commonly the emissary of the Hastur (who is served by the Mi Go, and the half-brother and rival of Cthulhu).

Itztlacoliuhqui-Ixquimilli is Curved Point of Obsidian - Knife Eye Bundle, the god of frost, ice, cold, winter, sin, punishment and human misery. He is also the god of objectivity and blind-folded justice. He is a variant of Tezcatlipoca and associated with the night and the north.

Long before the dawn of humanity, the Serpent Men created the Cobra Crown via power drawn from Set to create "an empire of the Earth" from the land that would become Valusia. The Crown was worn by Serpent Men kings but eventually proved defective and was hidden under a black shrine to Tsathoggua, a toad-demon ally of Set's. It was guarded by a living stone idol of the Toad-God on the Nameless Isle and would not be found for millennia. Set also empowered the lesser-powered Serpent Amulet and other talismans.

	It was the eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth's centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players.

Cthugha

In Derleth's version of the Cthulhu Mythos, Cthugha is a Great Old One, an elemental spirit of fire opposed to the Elder Gods.

Nyaruko
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaruko:_Crawling_with_Love

The story of Haiyore! Nyaruko-san centers around Nyaruko, a formless Lovecraftian-deity of chaos (Nyarlathotep) who can take on the shape of a seemingly ordinary silver-haired girl. Mahiro Yasaka is a normal high school boy who is being chased by a fearsome black alien one night, until Nyaruko saves him. She explains that the creatures from H. P. Lovecraft's works are actually races of aliens, and that she has been sent to Earth by the Space Defense Agency to protect him from being kidnapped by an alien trafficker. Aliens find Mahiro and the Earth strangely attractive, for entertainment, auction or resources. One by one, the Great Old Ones enter Earth illegally. Eventually, Nyaruko and two other Lovecraft-creatures, Cthugha and Hastur, end up being freeloaders at Mahiro's place.[4] Mahiro has become accustomed to his protection detail of Nyaruko, Cthugha, and Hastur making his life fascinating.
