The Mystery of Illyrio Mopatis
===================

This is a subject that I have been thinking about for four years, since I finished A Dance with Dragons and the rest of the books in a furious month of reading. Who, really, is Illyrio? Why is he so powerful and rich, with interests seemingly spread across the world, but so deeply involved with Westerosi politics that he would sneak into the Red Keep? 

What, really, is the origin of his partnership with Varys?

Why is he so light on his feet when Arya sees him with Varys? 

Why should we believe any of the stories that he told Tyrion about his motives? 

Why does Tyrion Lannister call him a "rotting sea cow" the second he saw him? And compare him to a rotting sea cow that once washed up in Casterly Rock?

**And who, really, is Serra of Lys, Illyrio's great love and second wife?** 

Why does Lyseni involvement in Westerosi politics always have a hint of sorcery, and of greater, terrible mischief? 

**None of it adds up. The facts as presented to us through the eyes of Dany, Arya, and Tyrion are not congruent.**

Even the Blackfire Theory, as powerful a theory as I have encountered, can't make all of these facts fit.

So I have sought to look deeper, to find threads of thinking that lead to a greater truth and tie together these loose ends. And I have a new theory based on a litany of George's clues, strewn throughout all of the published stories, that point to out who Illyrio is, and what it means for the future of the stories and the future of Westeros.

**And it all beings with Serra.**

Because Serra means Mermaid

Illyrio has been a huge part of the series, with but a few appearances.
