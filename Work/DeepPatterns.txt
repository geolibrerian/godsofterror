Patterns of the Deep Ones


Let me first set the conditions that will mark their return. If the Deep Ones are returning, followed by their terrible Fathers, they will follow the pattern that George has established for them:

  + They will come from the sea, and steal the women, and possibly kill or eat the men.
  + They would then mate with the women, mate with the daughters of those matings, while eating the males.
  + They would inspire worship by the terriorized populace on land.
