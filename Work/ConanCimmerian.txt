It's important to understand that George RR Martin is a huge Lovecraft Mythos fan, in all its many and varied forms. By exploring the early influence of HP Lovecraft and his collaborators on early fantasy as a genre, and on George in specific, the magic and the role of the gods in  A Song of Ice and Fire can be more properly understood.

According to a great essay he wrote in his "Starter Kit" collection of stories, his love of fantasy began in 1963, when he purchased [*Swords and Sorcery*,][Swords] edited by the famous writer and polymath, [L. Sprague de Camp][Camp].  With a story of Conan the Barbarian by **Robert E. Howard**, bundled with other stories of fantasy and terror by Poul Anderson, Henry Kuttner, **Clark Aston Smith**, Lord, Dunsany, and **H.P. Lovecraft** (*emphasis mine on writers who both borrowed and extended the Mythos*), this first fantasy series inspired his great love for the genre. It also influenced A Song of Ice and Fire, especially the terrible [Gods of Terros][Terror]. 

#Themes of the stories

## Terrible Gods

Snake Gods, Toad Gods, gods of cruelty and revenge, 

##Gods and man interacting

##Beyond the North Wind

A Homeric reference, Hyberborea was a mythical place to the ancient Greeks where a paradise awaited "Beyond the North Wind" (the literal translation of Hyperborea).


## Conan the Barbarian

Conan the Barbarian was his first love, and its worth a refresher on the story to see how Howard developed Conan and drew from the Mythos to create his world and gods, and the peoples that worship them. The time is ancient and the place is a mystical land full of peoples both similar and different than modern humans. Known as the [Hyborian Age][Hybor], **it is a violent Iron Age setting with swordsmen, mysterious sorcerors, and religons with terrible gods** that demand blood sacrifices, set 10,000 years or more before Caeser (though some editors placed it even further back to before the last Ice Age).   

### Hyborians

The Hyborian Age began after the sinking of the ancient civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria, which set back humanity to a primative state ["hardly above Neanderthal".][Hybor] These people, the Hyborians, escaped the destruction of the ancient civilizations and fled to the north, where they fought a race of snow apes. Defeating the snow apes and driving them north of the Arctic Circle, they adapt to the land and multiply. Eventually, the Hyborians begin return to lands south of them, and wars between the dispersing tribes of Hyborians became frequent.

A thousand years having past, the snow apes of the Arctic Circle had become fair-haired and tall men, who return to attack the Hyborians, setting the stage for the stories of Conan the Barbarian.


##Conan the Cimmerian

Conan was a Cimmerian, one of the many peopls of the Hyborian Age. Based on Celtic and/or Gaelic influences, the Cimmerians descended from the Hyborians and are a hard people with black hair and gray eyes (and are probably white, as most of these early - and recent- fantasy stories tended to be).  They are located about where Ireland or Scotland would be in the map of the world developed by Howard.

Born the son of a blacksmith, he eventually becomes a great warrior and even the King of Aquilonia. No man is stronger, and the giant man uses his strength and his cunning to improve his lot in the hard world. He speaks many languages and is a born leader, with a humor and wit streaked with "grim" irony. 

[His great love was the woman **Valeria**][Val], a pirate and adventuress and a member of the Red Brotherhood of pirates. She is a superior swordswoman who can even best Conan, being faster and more agile. She is his love in the 1982 movie Conan the Barbarian.

Gods of the Hyborian Age
------------

There are a great many gods worshipped by the many cultures of the Hyborian Age. They are at war with each other, just like the [gods of Terros.][Terror] These wars take form through their followers and through direct intervention by the gods, to destroy the territories of the followers of rival gods.

The major gods of the Hyborian Age were a mix of mythical ancestors such as [Crom for the Cimmerians][Crom] and Bori for the Hyperboreans, figures of sacrifices, and evil demons and snake gods. This is linked to the ancient gods of the Nordics and/or the Celtics by geography and rituals. Crom is seen to judge warriors before they are allowed into Valhalla.

In the major kingdoms of Aquilonia, Argos, Nemedia, and Zingara were [Mitra and][Mitra] [Father Set][Set]. Mitra is worshipped as a cross between a Christ-figure and Mitra/Mithras of the Zoroastrian and Vedic, and later Roman, mythos. Mitra even speaks directly to a love interest of Conan's to help her and him defeat their enemies and lead Conan to become King of Aquilonia. Notably, there are no blood sacrifices to Mitra, and his adherants spread his religion to other lands at great personal peril.

Father Set is a seven-headed snake god, mainly worshipped in the dark lands of the Stygians. His dark followers offer Set human sacrifices ["and sorcerous obscenities"][Worship]. In previous ages (discussed below), Set created a race of Serpent Men to serve him, but they were defeated by humans and disappeared. Even so, his worship continues and was even featured in the first Conan movie.

Father Set is identified with the [Great Old One Yig][Yig], and was either directly borrowed by Howard for Conan or was a major influence on Set. 
 
Naga the Sea Snake
------------- 

In the Marvel Comics version of the Conan universe, there is a [sea man/snake god known as Naga][Naga]. First published in 1969, Naga is the ruler of the *Homo mermanus* or water-breathing merpeople who live in the remains of Lemuria, which had sunk into the sea before the Hyborian Age. He finds in the ancient ruins of Lemuria the ancient Serpent Crown of the followers of Set. Through this crown, Set controls Naga though he has been banished to another dimension. Nage is transformed into a snake-like merman, with green, scaly skin instead of the blue skin common to the merpeople. Naga gains immortality and control over his people, whom he converts to the worship of Set. Naga's people become green in color and also have scales.
 
Multiple other gods, from the Cthulhu Mythos or inspired by it, appear throughout the Conan stories. Nyarlathotep is one of the gods worshipped in the mythos of the Hyborian Age. [Dagon, a Fish or Water God with a long history,][Dagon] was added to the Conan universe by Marvel in the 1970s. He can raise the dead as zombies and uses them as servants - a common motif in Mythos stories.

[Tsathoggua][Tsath], the Toad God, or Seven-Eyed Tsathoggua, makes an early appearance (1932) in the Conan stories, where he forms an alliance with Set and his minions. Conan is his enemy, or one of them, but Tsathoggua has his worshippers as well. In the Conan stories, he carries all of the backstory from the Mythos, where he is related to Cthulhu and other Great Old Ones.
 
Tsathoggua was created by Clark Ashton Smith, who created the Hyperborean Cycle. Tsathoggua was featured in the 


### Development of Conan

Robert E. Howard wrote 21 short stories and 1 novel about Conan the Barbarian before his suicide in 1936.

After Howard's unfortunate death, the copyright passed to a few different men. L. Sprague de Camp, the editor of the *Swords and Sorcery* anthology that welcomed George to the world of fantasy, was one. Another was Lin Carter, who became one of George's editors and friends in the 1970s. 

Howard's original stories had more direct relationship to the Cthulhu Mythos, but many of the references were removed in the reworking and rewriting of the material by the later editors. However, these editors borrowed liberally for place names from the [Hyberborian Cycle][Hyberborian] by Clark Aston Smith and kept many of the references to Mythos Gods.

The crossover was not one direction. Lovecraft mentions "Crom-Ya, a Cimmerian chieftain" in *The Shadow Out of Time* in 1924.

A great amount of development of the world of Conan also took place in the Marvel Comics version of the Hyborian Age. This should not be dismissed as an influence as it's clear that George has had a love affair with comics that might still be ongoing.




##Other writings by Howard

Howard wrote other stories that were similiarly set in a familiar fantasy setting. The [Thurian Age][Thurian] was set in the epoch before the cataclysm that destroy Atlantis and Lemuria. It is, like A Song of Ice and Fire, a mixture of a fantasy Iron Age setting with Lovecraftian gods.


There were three main tribes of "barbarian" men: Atlantis, Lemuria, and the Pictish Islands. Each represents an area in the real world, and the current inhabitants of those regions are said to be the descendents of these peoples.

[Valusia][Serpent]

> Following the cataclysm that destroys the Thurian Age, Atlantis sinks beneath the sea. The survivors on the Thurian continent are forced back into the stone age by lack of resources but become skilled in this medium and develop an artistic culture. They soon enter a war with the surviving Picts and lose to their superior numbers and stone-age military technology. The survivors of the war devolve back into apes. They eventually re-evolve into humans to become the Cimmerians of the Hyborian Age. In turn the Cimmerians become the Celts, Gaels and Scythians of modern, real world, [history.][Thurian]


> A great cataclysm ends the Thurian Age some time after the Kull stories. Several countries sink into the sea, others rise from it, and the rest is devastated by earthquakes and volcanoes. Civilization is destroyed and the survivors attempt to build a new culture but warfare and a Lesser Cataclysm strike, creating the Hyborian Vilayet Sea and destroying any last remnants of [Thurian society.][Thurian]

#Red Sonja

[Red Sonja][Sonja] was developed from an original story by Howard called "The Shadow of the Vulture", published in 1934. She was added to the Conan Universe in 1973 by Roy Thomas, a writer for Marvel Comics. Red Sonja was recast as a warrior woman from Hyrkania, an ancient, eastern land of steppes and forest, placed in modern day Ukraine. This Hyrkania is based on the real-world kingdom of Hyrkania that was located at the southern tip of the Caspian Sea.



# Other stories in the anthology

L. Sprague de Camp's *Swords and Sorcery* contained other stories that are even more deeply involved in the Cthulhu Mythos.

## Hyberborean Cycle

Clark Aston Smith's collections of Mythos stories are known collectively as the Hyperborean Cycle. With a solid Mythos universe background, Smith expanded the universe greatly to include important Great Old Ones such as Tsathoggua. Like the stories of Conan, they also portray an Iron Age setting with layers of cosmic horror. In the continent of Hyperborea, terrible gods demand blood sacrifices and prey on humans.

Right there in *Swords and Sorcery*, that first fantasy collection, was one of the Hyberborean stories: [*The Testimony of Athammaus*][Testy]. It concerned the city of Commoriom, the capital of Hyberborea. An evil, outlaw descendent of Tsathoggua and a snake god is found and beheaded, only to return again and take what he desired.

In Smith's writings, he details two other humanoid peoples that have fought against humans in the past: the Voormi and the Gor

## Sarnath and Bokrug

One of the earliest short stories by Lovecraft is [*The Doom That Came to Sarnath*][Sarnath], published in 1920.  It's a clear influence on The World of Ice and Fire and the main story, and it concerns an ancient war against unhuman beings who worship one of the Great Old Ones, Bokrug. It too was included in *Swords and Sorcery*. 

It concerns the people of Sarnath, a race of shepherd people who live along the river Ai in the land called Mnar. In a search for more lands, the people pushed their borders to a vast lake at the heart of Mnar. There they built the crowning glory, the metropolis of Sarnath. It was there that they encountered the people of Ib, a strange people who lived across the lake. 

The people of Ib were green of skin, with bulging eyes and curious ears and other odd features. They remind me of the people of the Thousand Islands in far Essos.

Eventually, the people of Sarnath destroyed the city of Ib, and killed all its inhabitants. They also stole a statute from Ib, a sea-green stone idol of Bokrug (the great water lizard who was said to inhabit the lake) to celebrate their victory over both the people, and the old gods, of Ib.

That night, something terrible happened. The next morning, the idol was gone, and the high priest of Sarnath was found dead in the  scrolled "DOOM" on the temple floor. No murderer was ever found, nor was the idol. The incident was hushed-up and forgotten.

Ten centuries later, the civilization of Sarnath is at its height. To celebrate the conquering of Ib, one thousand years previous, the king of Sarnath has a grand celebration. 


## Influences on A Song of Ice and Fire

	

### Cymmeri People of Essos

In the World of Ice and Fire, the Cymmerians are included as an ancient people of Essos, who banded with the [Tall Men of Sarnath][Sarnori], also known as the Sarnori. Known as the first people to work iron, the Cymmeri married into the Sarnori when the daughter of their king became one of Huzhor Amai's three wives.

### Huzhor Amai

Huzhor Amai (the Amazing) was said to be the first king of the Sarnori, and the descendent of the Fisher Queens. The Fisher Queens ruled the ancient inland sea that covered what is now the grasslands of the Dothraki Sea. Only three lakes remain of the Silver Sea, the great ancient inland sea, [another sign that Terros is much drier than it used to be in the past.][Dry] Huzhor bound together three tribes through his marriages, the Cymmeri, the Gipps, and the Zoqora, and battled the Qaathi and Old Ghis.

#The people of Ib

#The Patrimony of Hyrkoon




#My Conclusions

## Lots of similarities between the geographic  names and the names and roles of the gods

## The Hyborians sound a lot like the wildings of the North, specifically the Hyberborian tribe, who sound a lot like the Thenns. And if you compare a map of the Hyperborean Cycle lands, it looks a lot like the lands beyond the Wall - The Frostfangs 

## Red Sonja and the women of Hyrkoon

It's easy to sea a relationship between the Hyrkania of Conan and Red Sonja and the warrior women of the Patrimony of Hyrkoon in far Essos.

## Mitra and Mithras

The strong Mithraic symbolism that runs throughout the story arcs of Jon Snow and Bran was influenced by the religon of Mitra in Hyboria.

This symbolism is covered in great detail by a favorite writer of mine, [Lucifer Means Lightbringer.][LML] 

## The Fisher Queens were Deep Ones or even Giant Water Lizards

The Fisher Queens (who "were favored of the gods", according to Maester Yandel), sound like hybrids of the god Bokrug (the giant water lizard) from the Lovecraft story, "The Doom of Sarnath", and Deep Ones. These Queens were the result of the couplings between the gods and human woman. 

If Maester Yandel thinks that kings and other heros visited them for their wise counsel, it makes me suspicious, as do all Citadel-inspired views on these ancient rulers.

## Cymmeri and Andals?

The working of iron, and the similarity of the name Hugor (of the Hill) to Huzhor (Amai), and even to Mazor (Alexi), last king of the Sarnori, makes me suspect that there is some relationship between the Cymmeri and the Andals. 

## Huzhor Amai and the Bloodstone Emperor

Like the Bloodstone Emperor, Huzhor Amai was the last of a long line of royalty

## Huzhor Amai and Azor Ahai

Again, the similarities between Huzhor Amai (and Mazor Alexi) to Azor Ahai is really hard to dismiss.
