## Conan the Cimmerian

It's important to understand that George RR Martin is a huge Lovecraft Mythos fan, in all its many and varied forms. According to a great essay he wrote in his "Starter Kit" collection of stories, his love of fantasy began in 1963, when he purchased *Swords and Sorcery*, edited by [L. Sprague de Camp][Camp].  With a story of Conan the Barbarian by **Robert E. Howard**, bundled with other stories of fantasy and terror by Poul Anderson, Henry Kuttner, **Clark Aston Smith**, Lord, Dunsany, and **H.P. Lovecraft** (*emphasis mine on writers who both borrowed and extended the Mythos*), this first fantasy series inspired his great love for the genre. It also influenced A Song of Ice and Fire, especially the terrible [Gods of Terros][Terror]. 

Conan the Barbarian was his first love, and its worth a refresher on the story to see how Howard developed Conan and drew from the Mythos. The time is ancient and the place is a mystical land full of peoples that are both similar and different than modern humans. Known as the [Hyborian Age][Hybor], **it is a violent Iron Age setting with swordsmen, mysterious sorcerors, and religons with terrible gods** that demand blood sacrifices, set 10,000 years or more before Caeser (though some editors placed it even further back to before the last Ice Age).   

### Hyborians

The Hyborian Age began after the sinking of the ancient civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria, which set back humanity to a primative state ["hardly above Neanderthal".][Hybor] These people, the Hyborians, escaped the destruction of the ancient civilizations and fled to the north, where they fought a race of snow apes. Defeating the snow apes and driving them north of the Arctic Circle, they adapt to the land and multiply. Eventually, the Hyborians begin return to lands south of them, and wars between the dispersing tribes of Hyborians became frequent.

A thousand years having past, the snow apes of the Arctic Circle had become fair-haired and tall men, who return to attack the Hyborians, setting the stage for the stories of Conan the Barbarian.


Conan was a Cimmerian, one of the many peopls of the Hyborian Age. Based on Celtic and/or Gaelic influences, the Cimmerians descended from the Hyborians and are a hard people with black hair and gray eyes (and are probably white, as most of these early - and recent- fantasy stories tended to be).  They are located about where Ireland or Scotland would be in the map of the world developed by Howard.

The son of a blacksmith, he becomes a great warrior and the King of Aquilonia. No man is stronger, and the giant man uses his strength and his cunning to improve his lot in the hard world. He speaks many languages and is a born leader, with a humor and wit streaked with "grim" irony. 

### Development of Conan

Robert E. Howard wrote 21 short stories and 1 novel about Conan the Barbarian before his suicide in 1936.

After Howard's unfortunate death, the copyright passed to a few different men. L. Sprague de Camp, the editor of the *Swords and Sorcery* anthology that welcomed George to the world of fantasy, was one. Another was Lin Carter, who became one of George's editors and friends in the 1970s. 

Howard's original stories had more direct relationship to the Cthulhu Mythos, but many of the references were removed in the reworking and rewriting of the material by the later editors. However, these editors borrowed liberally for place names from the [Hyberborian Cycle][Hyberborian] by Clark Aston Smith and kept many of the references to Mythos Gods.

Nyarlathotep is one of the gods worshipped in the mythos of the Hyborian Age. 

The crossover was not one direction. Lovecraft mentions "Crom-Ya, a Cimmerian chieftain" in *The Shadow Out of Time* in 1924


##Other writings by Howard

Howard wrote other stories that were similiarly set in a familiar fantasy setting. The [Thurian Age][Thurian] was set in the epoch before the cataclysm that destroy Atlantis and Lemuria. It is, like A Song of Ice and Fire, a mixture of a fantasy Iron Age setting with Lovecraftian gods.


There were three main tribes of "barbarian" men: Atlantis, Lemuria, and the Pictish Islands.



> Following the cataclysm that destroys the Thurian Age, Atlantis sinks beneath the sea. The survivors on the Thurian continent are forced back into the stone age by lack of resources but become skilled in this medium and develop an artistic culture. They soon enter a war with the surviving Picts and lose to their superior numbers and stone-age military technology. The survivors of the war devolve back into apes. They eventually re-evolve into humans to become the Cimmerians of the Hyborian Age. In turn the Cimmerians become the Celts, Gaels and Scythians of modern, real world, [history.][Thurian]


> A great cataclysm ends the Thurian Age some time after the Kull stories. Several countries sink into the sea, others rise from it, and the rest is devastated by earthquakes and volcanoes. Civilization is destroyed and the survivors attempt to build a new culture but warfare and a Lesser Cataclysm strike, creating the Hyborian Vilayet Sea and destroying any last remnants of [Thurian society.][Thurian]

## Influences on A Song of Ice and Fire
	

### Cymmeri People of Essos

In the World of Ice and Fire, the Cymmerians are included as an ancient people of Essos, who banded with the [Tall Men of Sarnath][Sarnori], also known as the Sarnori. Known as the first people to work iron, the Cymmeri married into the Sarnori when the daughter of their king became one of Huzhor Amai's three wives.

### Huzhor Amai

Huzhor Amai (the Amazing) was said to be the first king of the Sarnori, and the descendent of the Fisher Queens. The Fisher Queens ruled the ancient inland sea that covered what is now the grasslands of the Dothraki Sea. Only three lakes remain of the Silver Sea, the great ancient inland sea, [another sign that Terros is much drier than it used to be in the past.][Dry] Huzhor bound together three tribes through his marriages, the Cymmeri, the Gipps, and the Zoqora, and battled the Qaathi and Old Ghis.




#My Conclusions

## The Hyborians sound a lot like the wildings of the North, specifically the Hyberborian tribe, who sound a lot like the Thenns.


## The Fisher Queens were Deep Ones

The Fisher Queens (who "were favored of the gods", according to Maester Yandel), sound like hybrids of the 

## Cymmeri and Andals?

The working of iron, and the similarity of the name Hugor (of the Hill) to Huzhor (Amai), and even to Mazor (Alexi), last king of the Sarnori 

## Huzhor Amai and the Bloodstone Emperor

Like the Bloodstone Emperor, Huzhor Amai was the last of a long line of royalty

## Huzhor Amai and Azor Ahai

Again, the similarities between Huzhor Amai and Mazor Alexi to Azor Ahai is really hard to dismiss.
