This is the second part of a Gods of Terror theory that posits that the Many-Faced God of the Faceless Men is the Cthulhu Mythos Outer God Nyarlathotep. [Review Part One here for more background about how this connection was made and how he has manifested in a major character.][Part1]

Part of the meta-analysis encompassed by the theory is that GRRM is showing that he can write better than most other heirs to Lovecraft. I think he took the ideas of the Cthulhu Mythos and extended them to include other myths such as the Green Man, and extended it to include his world building from the Ice Dragon and other earlier stories. 

For example, he married the masks/forms of Nyarlathotep to create the Many-Faced God, worshipped by the Cult of the Faceless Men. He created the Drowned God to represent memories of Cthulhu. And there are tons of other examples that exhibit GRRM's vast knowledge of the extensive Cthulhu Mythos stories and characters.

For me, the connections to the Cthulhu Mythos are more than just world building. Sure, it seems at first to be background filler... but the closer I look, the more I realized that the filler is in the foreground as well. If the gods of Terros are directly imported from the Mythos, are worshipped by the people of Terros for their powers as exhibited in the Mythos, and obey the 'rules' of the Mythos, than A Song of Ice and Fire takes place within the Mythos. 


What does that mean for A Song of Ice and Fire? Importantly, it means that these "gods" are real, and that they are not "gods" in the religious sense. They are actual cosmic beings that exist in the universe of ASOIAF, that have appeared on Terros but mostly live in outer space. 

It is important to understand that these cosmic beings mostly hate each other and have great wars that threaten the lives of humans and other lesser beings. These cosmic beings care very little about humans (except Nyarlathotep, who love to torture humans), and humans are caught in the middle of these wars. 

Every time humans encounter these beings, horrible things happen, but the power demonstrated by these beings invokes terror and wonder, and the human religions of Terros spring up to worship the beings they have encountered. The Cult of the Faceless Men worship Nyarlathotep, while the Iron Islanders worship the Drowned God, who correlates closely to Cthulhu. The Storm God, the Toad God, the Lord of Light, Shub-Niggurath, He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named: all Great Old Ones, and all worshipped by different groups on Terros. 

The Cthulhu Mythos also helps explain the presence of the giant black blocks of stone found throughout the world:


>"Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. **Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific**. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity." - HP Lovecraft, ["The Call of Cthulhu"][Call]

Within the Mythos, Nyarlathotep is special, as all of the other Great Old Ones are sleeping or banished to space. Nyarlathotep can still walk among humans, and he takes many different forms on Earth as he works to spread terror through fear, torture, and pain. As I explained in [Part One][Part1], Nyarlathothep has been present on Terros throughout history, and is currently inhabiting a number of avatars to work towards his dark ends.


##The Long Night and the Bloodstone Emperor

As I concluded in [Part One][Part1], the Long Night was started by the Bloodstone Emperor, who worshiped a black stone that fell from space. The story *[The Haunter of the Dark][Haunter]* tells of the Shining Trapezohedron, the black stone used to call a god of terror known as the Haunter of the Dark, who is a manifestation of Nyarlathotep. This direct link between the horror of the Long Night, and the Church of Starry Wisdom, which was founded by the Bloodstone Emperor, spells ill omens for the future of the story. 

I also have concluded that Euron Greyjoy has been taken over by Nyarlathotep. He is working to secure the Shining Trapezohedron, which I believe is housed in the Hightower of Oldtown, where it has been watched over by the descendants of [Uthor of the High Tower][Uthor], who slew a dragon and established his house on Battle Island in the mythical past of Westeros. Uthor is a corruption of [Ulthar, the Mythos god and son of Sothoth sent down to Earth (or Terros) to watch over the Great Old Ones as they sleep][Ulthar]. 


>When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious surrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals. - HP Lovecraft, ["The Call of Cthulhu"][Call]

In this passage, we can uncover a lot information that relates to the Great Old Ones (the group of cosmic beings to which Cthulhu has been assigned by Lovecraft), and also relates to the prophetic dreams of the Dreamers, whose actions may be influenced by these psychic waves eminating from the mind of Cthulhu as he sleeps in R'lyeh. 

The most important bit of information is that someone, or something, must awaken the gods because they are sleeping using spells that prevent them from waking themselves. It has been theorized that after a great battle in the past, the Great Old Ones were put to sleep by the Elder Ones. Could this battle have been the great battle for the Dawn?  

The Outer God Ghroth (the Harbinger), an entity introduced by [Ramsey Campbell][Ramsey] (a Mythos writer and friend and editor of GRRM), is described as a red sphere that passes through space, singing a siren song known as the *Music of the Spheres*. As he passes through space, he awakens any sleeping Great Old One on the planets that he passes. This has been the cause of mass extinctions on Earth.

Ghroth reminds me strongly of the red comet at the beginning of *A Clash of Kings*. Perhaps Ghroth passed by Terros, and helped to weaken the spells of the Elder Ones, and awaken the magic of dragons, but the spells require a great blood sacrifice to end them once and for all. With the help of Nyarlathotep and his avatars, the Great Old Ones will be freed from the spells that bind them.


###Blood Ritual
As we see in the Aeron sample chapter, Euron is preparing for a blood sacrifice in the sea off Oldtown. He has strapped holy men of many different religons onto the bows of ships, including his own brother, Aeron Greyjoy. What is his endgoal with this sacrifice? Is he is working to call back the Deep Ones to aid his invasion of Westeros? 


Euron's treatment of Aeron, and of the 4 warlocks of Qarth, are perfect examples of his ability to torture men to madness. He kills one of the warlocks, to show that he meant business, and then chained them up and made them eat the dead warlock (and probaly themselves). In "The Forsaken", we see what's left of Pyat Pree: a man without legs, who has clearly been driven mad:  

>Last were two warlocks of the east, with flesh as white as mushrooms, and lips the purplish?-blue of a bad bruise, all so gaunt and starved that only skin and bones remained. One had lost his legs. The mutes hung him from a rafter. ?Pree,? he cried as he swung back and forth. ?Pree, Pree!?


His speech to Aeron displays his desire to kill men and replace the gods recalls the role of Nyarlathotep as a trickster gods of terror. Lovecraft's epic poem [Fungi from Yuggoth][Fungi] gives clues about how Euron's blood sacrifice will begin the descruction of the world, as the "idiot Chaos", or Nyarlathotep, births death from the sea.

>Soon from the sea a noxious birth began;
Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold;
The ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolled
Down on the quaking citadels of man.
Then, crushing what he chanced to mould in play,
[The idiot Chaos blew Earthâ€™s dust away.][Fungi]

I think that this passage portens both the terrible doom that is about to befall Terros, and the nature of the gods involved in the coming Long Night. The second line ("Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold") invokes the Westerlands and the gold of the Casterly Rock, and the fourth line ("Down on the quaking cidadels of man") I associate with Oldtown, home of the Citadel. 

##Towers By The Sea

It's no coincidence that Euron is preparing for the invasion of Oldtown. In fact, it has been hinted about by many major characters.

Melisandre has visions of a tower by the sea overwhelmed by a dark tide that rises from the depths:

>Then the towers by the sea, crumbling as the dark tide came sweeping over them, rising from the depths. (ADWD, Melisandre)

>I saw towers by the sea, submerged beneath a black and bloody tide. (ADWD, Melisandre I)


Moroqqo, who I have also associated with Nyarlathotep after his transformation in the sea (check out the difference in how he is described between the Tyrion chapters and the Victarion chapters), mentions a similar vision in this exchange with Tyrion:

>"Have you seen these others in your fires?" he asked, warily. "Only their shadows," Moqorro said. "One most of all. A tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms, sailing on a sea of blood." (ADWD, Tyrion VIII)




Euron's ultimate goal is not just to drive men mad and to spread chaos and fear. He is the harbinger of doom, Death, the Lion of Night, here to remake the world again. And he will do this by calling back from the dead the terrible Great Old Ones.

He will have some help with his terrible mission, from a mysterious and dark House of Westeros.


##Oldtown and the Hightowers

The plot of  *The Winds of Winter* promises to focus on the taking of Oldtown by the Ironborn. This ancient city, long the domain of the even more ancient Hightower family, has two notable features: the eponymous Hightower, a stone tower built on top of an mysterious black stone fort on Battle Isle, and the Citadel, the major center of learning in Westeros, where all maesters are trained and where Samwell Tarly has been sent at the end of A Dance with Dragons.

I have long suspected that the Hightowers of Oldtown, that ancient family that traces back to Uthar Hightower and Maris the Maid, were involved in worship of the Outer Gods. Not only are they ancient - much too ancient, really, for any of the timelines of the arrival of the First Men to make sense - but they are also known to dabble in sorcery. 

Anytime that a wizard or sorceror is using magic in the Cthulhu Mythos, they are attempting to communicate or call one of the Great Old Ones or the Outer Gods. Usually, it takes blood  sacrifice to get the attention of the gods. I suspect that the rumours of sorcery by the Hightowers (in particular Leyton Hightower and his sister, the Mad Maid), are related to the desire to awaken the Great Old Ones.

###Ulthar
If you have been following the Gods of Terror theory to this point, it should come as no surprise to learn that there is a Cthulhu Mythos diety named Ulthar (or Uldar or even Ultharathotep), who is a son of Yog-Sothoth and is considered and "Elder God". Ulthar, according to the (fictional) *Sussex Manuscript* was sent to Earth to **keep a vigil** over the sleeping or banished Great Old Ones/Outer Gods. 

The words of House Hightower: "We Light The Way". What way are they lighting? For whom are they lighting the way? It's worth noting here the definitions of "vigil": 

> 1. wakefulness maintained for any reason during the normal hours for sleeping.
2. a watch or a period of watchful attention maintained at night or at other times:
3. a period of wakefulness from inability to sleep.


Uthar Hightower, according to legends, killed a dragon roosting on Battle Isle and then worked with Bran the Builder to build the Hightower on top of the ancient black stone fort. He then claimed (or stole) Maris the Maid from a giant (who swore revenge on Uthar) and founded the line of Hightowers that continues into the contemporary story.



I suspect something else. The Shining Trapezohedron, the black stone that fell from Earth and was worshiped by the Bloodstone Emperor, which he used to call the Lion of Night, is in the Hightower. It would explain Euron's desire to capture the Hightower: his plan to awaken the sleeping Great Old Ones. With the help of the Hightowers and blood sacrifice, Euron will invoke Nyarlathotep, the Lion of Night.


>...and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.


###The Church of Starry Wisdom

Euron and the Hightowers are not the only players in the mission to call back the Great Old Ones and remake the world.

As seen in [The Haunter of the Dark][Dark], the Church of Starry Wisdom has the Shining Trapezohedron stored in the high tower of the creepy church. And the cultists of the Church perform blood sacrifices to The Haunter of the Dark, the terrible avatar of Nyarlathotep with a three-lobed burning eye with wings. 

The Church of Starry Wisdom is present throughout Terros in the modern era, worshiped at port cities by sailors and others. It has been mentioned in *A Dance With Dragons* and is also hinted at in *A Feast for Crows*, as it is suspected that Marwin the Mage visits their temple in the port of Oldtown.

###The Citadel

The Citadel was founded by decree of the second Hightower, who declared that its mission was to learn the arts of man. It is known to be anti-dragon, and is also suspected to be complicit in the downfall of the Targaryens. 

I don't know the degree of control over the Citadel that the Hightowers hold, but there is a deep association. They were founded by them, and have collected information about the lords and the laymen of Westeros from that beginning. In fact, in reading the *Princess and the Queen* and *The Rogue Prince*, there is a lot of innuendo about their role in starting the Dance of the Dragons. 

Why do they hate the Dragons so? Is it just because of their institutional aversion to magic? Or does it go much deeper?

###Faceless Men and Braavos

Are they an international cult of assasins who are working to hasten the return of the Great Old Ones? I do have my suspicions. The Faceless Men have been trying to get the book on killing dragons, and they probably helped to cause the Doom of Valyria, so they do seem to have it out for the dragon people who might oppose them, whatever their ultimate goals might be.



###Other Religions

After deep study of the world book, it seems clear that the founders of Norvos and Qohor, while Valyrian, were not dragon-riding Valyrians. In Norvos, they stuck with Hastur, The Great Shepherd. In Qohor they switched to The Black Goat. In Volantis, they worship the Lord of Light.

The followers of the Lord of Light hate the followers of the Norvoshi religion and the Qohorik religion, and the feeling is mutual. While [I think that the Norvoshi worship Hastur, the Magnum Innonominandum or He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-named][Magnum], the Black Goat is Shub-Niggurath, [The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young][Goat]. (It's worth noting that in ["The Mound" by Lovecraft][Mound], Shub-Niggurath is described as the wife of the Not-To-Be-Named One, [who is Hastur.][Magnum])


##War Between The Gods

Importantly, the enmity between the followers of R'hllor and these other religions represent the greater war between the Gods of Terros. I don't say this lightly; I've devoted a ton of time over the last few years trying to understand what is really going on in Westeros and Essos and Sothoryos and Leng and beyond; this [Tumblr is the result][Terror]. But this was all building to this point: that these gods are not make-believe, but are instead powerful beings beyond the understanding of humans, that are at war with each other.

Indeed, we see the war between Cthulhu and Hastur in the hatred of the Ironborn for the Storm God; and the battles at Storm's End between Durran Godsgrief and the Storm God. We see the death cult of the Many-Faced God arise in Valyria as Nyarlathotep battles Cthugha (the Lord of Light), which may have resulted in the Doom of Valyria.


#Conclusions

Why does all of this matter to the story? Isn't this a story of humans, dragons, ice demons, and telepathic paraplegics?

I suspect something else. The story will have a twist so massive that it's taken years to get it right.

As Leo Tyrell says in the beginning of *A Feast For Crows*, the story has changed, and an age of wonder and terror has begun:

>Dragons and darker things. The grey sheep have closed their eyes, but the mastiff sees the truth. Old powers awaken. Shadows stir. An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon us, an age for gods and heroes.

As the Others have been lurking over the story for five books, it is both perfectly normal for them to be seen as the old power that have returned. But I suspect that it is a feint, a ruse even, by George, as cruel as that may be to his readers. 

In fact, I believe that the Others will not be the ultimate evil faced in the story, and Old Nan will be proven wrong once again. Instead, the evil will come from the "gods" themselves as they seek to return to Terros.


*I believe that the great war that will end A Song of Ice and Fire will not happen in the North, against the Others, but will instead be centered around Oldtown and the Riverlands.*

##Tinfoil Time
Here is my predictions for how all of this will be set up in *The Winds of Winter* (I'll save my *A Dream of Spring* predictions for next time):

Euron's blood sacrifice will be used to awaken an ancient evil: the Deep Ones. He will call an army of these terrible hybrid beings to help him invade Westeros. The blood sacrifice will not be strong enough to break the spells keeping the Great Old Ones sleeping, but the Deep Ones, the half-human/half-fish descendants of the gods, will come above water en masse for the first time since the Battle for the Dawn. These beings are known as the squishers in the east, silkies in the far north.

He and his hybrid minions will strike at Oldtown, where they will overwhelm the defenders of the city. Euron will capture the Hightower, where he finds a willing partner in the Mad Maid, Malora Hightower.

Euron and Malora will join forces to perform a blood sacrifice using the Shining Trapezohedron. But they need a person with incredibly powerful blood to sacrifice: Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons.

Euron has already set his plan in motion to capture Dany, by sending Victarion to Slaver's Bay. Using the dragon horn, Victarion will bind the will of a dragon, but he will not capture it himself. Instead, Euron has enchanted the horn to make the dragon respond only to him. Victarion thinking himself strong enough and desiring Dany, will blow the horn and die, and the dragon will fly off to find his new master: Euron.

Dany, mother of dragons, will suspend her war in Essos and her planned invasion of Westeros to find her dragon. She will follow the dragon to Oldtown and will be captured by Euron and the Mad Maid. Her fleet and army will follow, but may be too late, for the blood of kings flows through her veins, and only that magic can break the spell and awaken the Great Old Ones......

**End Scene**

##Post Script
This theory borrows and extends [PoorQuentyn's Eldritch Apolocalypse][Poor] theory, so I must give him credit. But I'm taking it further, into the Land of Lovecraft, because that's where I see the ultimate twist occuring: the form of the ultimate evil, and the role of the "gods", who I believe are the cosmic beings of the Cthulhu Mythos. 

More to come!
