##What does this mean?

Good question. I think that it highlights both the terrible doom that is about to befall Terros, and the nature of the gods involved in the coming Long Night. 

Nyarlathotep loves to drive men mad, using chaos and fear to destroy the minds of men.


For me, the connections to the Cthulhu Mythos are more than just world building. Sure, it seems at first to be background filler... but if A Song of Ice and Fire takes place within the Mythos, then the gods of Terros are directly from the Mythos as well. 

What does that mean? That these gods are, first, real. They are actual cosmic beings that exist in the universe of ASOIAF. And, they hate each other (they care very little about humans, except Nyarlathotep, who love to torture humans), and humans are just caught in between their wars. 

And it also means that they will return from their banishment - Cthulhu from the dept


###Euron Greyjoy's Endgame
Euron's treatment of the 4 warlocks is a perfect example of his ability to inflect madness. He kills one of them, to show that he meant business, and then chained them up and made them eat the dead warlock (and probaly themselves). In "The Forsaken", we see what's left of Pyat Pree: a man without legs, who has clearly been driven mad:  

>Last were two warlocks of the east, with flesh as white as mushrooms, and lips the purplish?-blue of a bad bruise, all so gaunt and starved that only skin and bones remained. One had lost his legs. The mutes hung him from a rafter. ?Pree,? he cried as he swung back and forth. ?Pree, Pree!?

But his ultimate goal is not just to drive men mad and to spread chaos and fear. He is the harbinger of doom, Death, the Lion of Night, here to remake the world again. And he will do this by calling back from the dead the terrible Great Old Ones.



>"Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. **Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific**. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity." - HP Lovecraft, ["The Call of Cthulhu"][Call]

>When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious surrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals. - HP Lovecraft, ["The Call of Cthulhu"][Call]

##Oldtown and the Hightowers

The plot of  *The Winds of Winter* promises to focus on the taking of Oldtown by the Ironborn. This ancient city, long the domain of the even more ancient Hightower family, has two notable features: the eponymous Hightower, a stone tower built on top of an mysterious black stone fort on Battle Isle, and the Citadel, the major center of learning in Westeros, where all maesters are trained and where Samwell Tarly has been sent at the end of A Dance with Dragons.

I have long suspected that the Hightowers of Oldtown, that ancient family that traces back to Uthar Hightower and Maris the Maid, were involved in worship of the Outer Gods. Not only are they ancient - much too ancient, really, for any of the timelines of the arrival of the First Men to make sense - but they are also known to dabble in sorcery. 

Anytime that a wizard or sorceror is using magic in the Cthulhu Mythos, they are attempting to communicate or call one of the Great Old Ones or the Outer Gods. Usually, it takes blood  sacrifice to get the attention of the gods. I suspect that the dabbling by the Hightowers (in particular Leyton Hightower and his sister, the Mad Maid).

###Ulthar
It should come as no surprise to learn that there is a Cthulhu Mythos diety named Ulthar (or Uldar or even Ultharathotep), who is a son of Yog-Sothoth and is considered and "Elder God". Ulthar, according to the (fictional) *Sussex Manuscript* was sent to Earth to **keep a vigil** over the sleeping or banished Great Old Ones/Outer Gods. 

The words of House Hightower: "We Light The Way". What way are they lighting? For whom are they lighting the way? It's worth noting here the definitions of "vigil": 

> 1. wakefulness maintained for any reason during the normal hours for sleeping.
 2. a watch or a period of watchful attention maintained at night or at other times:
 3. a period of wakefulness from inability to sleep.


Uthar Hightower, according to legends, killed a dragon roosting on Battle Isle and then worked with Bran the Builder to build the Hightower on top of the ancient black stone fort. He then claimed (or stole) Maris the Maid from a giant (who swore revenge on Uthar) and founded the line of Hightowers that continues into the contemporary story.


>...and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.


###The Church of Starry Wisdom

I suspect something else. The Shining Trapezohedron, the black stone that fell from Earth and was worshiped by the Bloodstone Emperor, might be in the Hightower. As seen in [The Haunter of the Dark][Dark], the Church of Starry Wisdom has the Shining Trapezohedron stored in the high tower of the creepy church. And the cultists of the Church perform blood sacrifices to The Haunter of the Dark, the terrible avatar of Nyarlathotep with a three-lobed burning eye with wings.

###The Citadel

##Faceless Men and Braavos
Part of the point that GRRM is making is that he can write better than most other heirs to Lovecraft, and I think he took this idea and married it to the masks/forms of Nyarlathotep to create the Faceless Men.

Are they an international cult of assasins who are working to hasten the return of the Great Old Ones? I do have my suspicions. The Faceless Men have been trying to get the book on killing dragons, and they probably helped to cause the Doom of Valyria, so they do seem to have it out for the dragon people who might oppose them, whatever their ultimate goals might be.

##Religious War
It seems clear that the founders of Norvos and Qohor, while Valyrian, were not dragon-riding Valyrians. In Norvos, they stuck with Hastur, The Great Shepherd. In Qohor they switched to The Black Goat. In Volantis, they worship the Lord of Light.

The followers of the Lord of Light hate the followers of the Norvoshi religion and the Qohorik religion, and the feeling is mutual. While [I think that the Norvoshi worship Hastur, the Magnum Innonominandum or He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-named][Magnum], the Black Goat is Shub-Niggurath, [The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young][Goat]. (It's worth noting that in ["The Mound" by Lovecraft][Mound], Shub-Niggurath is described as the wife of the Not-To-Be-Named One, [who is Hastur.][Magnum])



Importantly, the enmity between the followers of R'hllor and these other religions represent the greater war between the Gods of Terros. I don't say this lightly; I've devoted a ton of time over the last few years trying to understand what is really going on in Westeros and Essos and Sothoryos and Leng and beyond; this [Tumblr is the result][Terror]. But this was all building to this point: that these gods are not make-believe, but are instead powerful beings beyond the understanding of humans, that are at war with each other.

Instead, we see the war between Cthulhu and Hastur in the hatred of the Ironborn for the Storm God; and the battles at Storm's End between Durran Godsgrief and the Storm God. We see the death cult of the Many-Faced God arise in Valyria as Nyarlathotep battles Cthugha, which I believe resulted in the Doom of Valyria and will cover later.
