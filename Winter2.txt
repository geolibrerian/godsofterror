I really appreciate your long comment, as I see the passion. Mostly this is for fun, and what fun it is. 

This theory, or this part of the theory at least, does seem to come out of nowhere. It's a completely different spin on what was considered a well established portion of the book and of theories spun off from the book.

And I do give my opinion, at the end, which also seems unlikely. But it is well thought out, and based on only the cannon literature of the 5 books, Dunk and Egg, the Winds of Winter chapter, and mostly the World of Ice and Fire.

I think that GRRM is a master of mystery writing, and the greatest mystery of the book is not who are the parents of Jon Snow.

The greatest mystery is the magic, and the gods from which it is derived. Who were the gods, and do they still exist? 

The complete background [is available here](http://godsofterror.tumblr.com), and I wrote it to be a fun and idea-challenging read, but it's based on these cannon facts:

The Deep Ones, which is a term that covers a lot of creatures, but they are all the result of sex between a god and a mortal:
  - GRRM is a huge Lovecraft fan, with Lovecraftian lore he has laid out in the "histories" in the WOIAF strong hints a mysterious ancient race or races that disappeared in pre-history. These are the Deep Ones and terrible ancient Gods 
  - Maester Theron, born in the Iron Islands, wrote of the Deep Ones
  - The people of Norvos worship the Deep Ones

  - The Patrimony of Hyrkoon worshiped, and was fathered by, the Deep Ones
  - The Great Empire of the Dawn was the Yi Ti name fore the Patrimony of Hyrkoon, and the Gemstone Emperors were Deep Ones.
  - The Empress of Leng "has congress with" the Deep Ones.
  - The people of the Thousand Islands worship and fear to death the Deep Ones
  - The squishers of Crackclaw Point are Deep Ones
  - The men of the Sisters show the mark of the Deep Ones
  - Garth Greenhair, Garth the Green, is a mystical being that is part fish, part man, part stag, part farmer, part father. Is he a Deep One? 
  - While some of the stories of Garth are pleasant, the oldest of them are disturbing - he demanded blood sacrifices and died every autumn, only to return every spring. Was it he who taught men to sacrifice blood to the trees? 
  - The people of Qohor have daily and monthly blood sacrifices to the Black Goat
  - The green men of the Isle of Faces are green skinned horned men, which sounds exactly like Garth the Green.
  
The pattern of the Deep Ones
In all these places, the Deep Ones emerge from the water and rape the women of the land - not just the humans, either - and eat the men. They demand blood sacrifices, and they marry their own daughters and sometimes train them as solders. The human cultures that derive from them war against land based cultures usually represented by horse-riders or mountain dwellers. This is seen from Westeros to Leng.

Into this I need to include a [link to the Eldritch Apocalypse theory](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/tagged/eldritch-apocalypse), which has been enhanced to say the least since the reading of "The Forsaken", discussed here on [History of Westeros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwjmMDMo-tQ)

Basically it says that Euron is going to perform a blood sacrifice to call back the gods of the Deep - perhaps Cthulu or some other Lovecraftian horror.

Here are my greater surmises that I am assuming about, but with evidence that makes me comfortable about the guess.
I'll be writing about it here and at length, and will have lots of background to each guess.
Some of these are wild, but why not:

  - Some giant war went down between the Deep Ones and humans and the Children of the Forest, along with the Others. 
  - This banished or controlled the sea gods/gods of the deep for a time.
  - The Hightowers, who were at Battle Isle before Oldtown existed, let along was called Oldtown, are in with the Deep Ones 
  - They are there to light the way for the Deep Ones, not for the humans.
  - They founded the Citadel to gather intelligence on Westeros and the world
  - They also made sure to use the Citadel to record history in a way that deeply
