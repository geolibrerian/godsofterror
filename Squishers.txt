Return of the Squishers

I know that the reading of ASOIAF that includes Deep Ones has been whispered about for years in the forums of [Reddit](http://reddit.com/s/asoiaf) or [Westeros.org](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/), but was mostly in jest, or resembiling a crack-pipe made from tinfoil. 

[I'm having a lot of fun with this theory](godsofterror.tumblr.com), but I assure you that I am not smoking crack. The background of the return of the ancient Gods of Terror has been laid carefully throughout the books. I have detailed the story of the [Patrimony of Hyrkoon](http://godsofterror.tumblr.com/post/148954720381/greatfathers), of course, and I will be sure to add more details about this background over the next few days/weeks/months.

But I want to go forward, into the unpublished cannon of [Arianne in the Winds of Winter](http://www.georgerrmartin.com/excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter/), to show you that the Squishers/Deep Ones and their Fathers are already returning. 

Let me first set the conditions that will mark their return. If the Deep Ones are returning, followed by their terrible Fathers, they will follow the pattern that George has established for them:

  + They will come from the sea, and steal the women, and possibly kill or eat the men.
  + They would then mate with the women, produce offspring (more Deep Ones), mate with the daughters of those matings, while eating the males.
  + They would inspire worship by the terriorized populace on land.

This is the longterm pattern, [as seen in Hyrkoon](http://godsofterror.tumblr.com/post/149055573236/the-sons-of-hyrkoon-eaten-by-the-great-fathers). However, it all starts with the stealing of the women by raiders from the sea.

It's this start of the pattern that we find mentioned in the [Arianne II](http://www.georgerrmartin.com/excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter/) chapter. Hidden right in front of our noses, as usual when dealing with GRRM's mystery writing, is mention of the return of the Deep Ones:

>The town was large enough to support three inns, and all their common rooms were rife with rumors. Arianne sent her men into each of them, to hear what they might hear. In the Broken Shield, Daemon Sand was told that the great septry on the Holf of Men had been burned and looted by raiders from the sea, and a hundred young novices from the motherhouse on Maiden Isle carried off into slavery. In the Loon, Joss Hood learned that half a hundred men and boys from the Weeping Town had set off north to join Jon Connington at Griffin’s Roost, including young Ser Addam, old Lord Whitehead’s son and heir. But in the aptly named Drunken Dornishman, Feathers heard men muttering that the griffin had put Red Ronnet’s brother to death and raped his maiden sister. Ronnet himself was said to be rushing south to avenge his brother’s death and his sister’s dishonor.

THERE IT IS!!! 

There is the mark of the return of the Deep Ones. While it's well hidden in the (seemingly) more important action concerning the location of the Golden Company and Griffin’s Roost, that first report heard by Daemon Sand in the Broken Shield is more interesting to me.

For a great septry of the Holf of Men (what the hell is a holf?) was burned and looted by **raiders from the sea** ... and a **hundred young novices from the motherhouse on Maiden Isle were carried away.**

This was not a mistake. And this was not included by accident. 
GRRM specifically made a point to tell us about wrong information that was gathered by Sands in Weeping Town, south of Storms End and Shipbreaker Bay (i.e. the home of the Storm God).

I must remind people here that GRRM is writing a horror story and a mystery story with a facade of fantasy. The return of the Deep Ones, and the Gods of Terror, is a part of the mystery and a part of the horror. And it's all fun.

It's easy to dismiss this as a story of pirates, and similar behaviour is seen on the West Coast of Westeros by the Ironborn. But this is not just piracy, and the Ironborn themselves are following the pattern of the Deep Ones, as they worship the Deep Ones as best expressed by the Eldritch Apolaclypse theory on [PoorQuentyn](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/).

As I have said, I believe that the Empress of Leng will order the death of all strangers on the Holy Isle of Leng in TWOW, and this will also mark the full return of the Deep Ones. However, the Deep Ones are already active in the main story, [as they have been since the beginning](http://godsofterror.tumblr.com/post/149070919856/the-dead-direwolf).
