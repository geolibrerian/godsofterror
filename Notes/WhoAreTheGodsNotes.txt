HASTUR IS THE GREAT NOT TO BE NAMED, MAGNUM INNOMINANDUM 
Hastur is the Great Other to the followers of R'hllor, [he who shall not be named](http://kinginyellow.wikia.com/wiki/Hastur)
He is known by other names as well: The King in Yellow, the Feaster from Afar, and the High Priest not to be described, and the [Magnum Innominandum](http://kinginyellow.wikia.com/wiki/Magnum_Innominandum). 

[Hastur is a Great Old One](http://kinginyellow.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hastur_Mythos), half-brother to Cthuggha and Cthulhu, spawn of Yog-Sothoth.
Hastur was the god of shepards in the old days, when the Valyrians were shepards. But the Valyrians turned from Hastur when they discovered the power of the dragons. They turned to Cthuggha, god of fire, as their new god. They established the religion of R'hllor to worship Cthuggha as the Lord of Light and Shadows. Cthuggha and his flame vampires helped the Valyrians control the 14 Flames.

Hastur is not just linked by the name of the Great Other. Hastur has been present in a few forms in the histories of Terros. The key is the story of the [King in Yellow](http://kinginyellow.wikia.com/wiki/The_King_In_Yellow), which is part of the Hastur Mythos (a collection of Lovecraftian stories that focus on Hastur and his terrible forms). 

> Going by the original stories, The King In Yellow (the play) is linked in some nebulous and horrible fashion with the King in Yellow, an alien god whose "scalloped tatters ... must hide Yhtill forever". The King is in turn linked in some way with "Carcosa, where black stars hang in the heavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon, when the twin suns sink into the Lake of Hali". The King's nature, motives and modus operandi are unclear; but he occasionally appears on Earth, animating dead bodies or possessing those strange 'humans' already in thrall to him, and claiming (or reclaiming) those who have eluded him. To read the play is to be exposed to the King and to fall under his influence, going mad in the meantime.


In the World of Ice and Fire, the 69th Yellow Emperor of the Golden Empire of Yi Ti sounds a lot like the King in Yellow. Claiming to be from a dynasty said to have fallen a thousand years previous, this sorceror emperor rules from Carcosa along the shores of the Hidden Sea northeast of Asshai and the Shadow. 

There is also an ancient Yi Ti emperor who reminds me of another form of Hastur: the Feaster from Afar. [Lo Tho](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lo_Tho), was the twenty-second scarlet emperor. Like the 69th Yellow Emperor, he was a reputed sorceror, but was also a cannibal, "...who is said to have supped upon the living brains of his enemies with a long pearl-handled spoon, after the tops of their skulls had been removed."

The Feaster from Afar is known for as a "black, shrivled flying monstrosity" that had tentacles with razor sharp talons, which were used to eat the brains of the living. It's a bit of a stretch but it's not hard to see the connection between the tentacles of the Feaster and the more "refined" pearl-handled long spoon used by Lo the Longspoon. 

Hastur may also be - the Lovecraftian literature has multiple accounts here - The High Priest Not To Be Described. That form, where the being appears to be wearing a yellow mask but is not wearing a mask, has also been described as [the Last Elder One](http://kinginyellow.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Elder_One)

The Many-Faced God is the Faceless God of Death and Dismay, Nyarlathotep
The Fisher Queens of antiquity were probably related to Bokrug, as the Kingdom of Sarnath is related to the story "The Doom that Came to Sarnath".

White Worm is the God Rlim Shaikorth
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Ashton_Smith_deities#Rlim_Shaikorth
The White Worm travels on a gigantic iceberg called Yikilth, which it can guide across the ocean. In its colossal ice-citadel, the White Worm prowls the seas, blasting ships and inhabited land masses with extreme cold. Victims of the White Worm are frozen solid, their bodies appearing eerily white, and remain preternaturally cold—they will not melt nor warm even when exposed to fire. (The Coming of the White Worm, 1941)


Yhoundeh
In Smith's The Door to Saturn, Yhoundeh the elk-goddess is the name of the deity worshipped in the waning days of Hyperborea. Yhoundeh's priests also banned Tsathoggua's cult, and her inquisitors punished any heretics. As the Hyperborean civilization drew to a close, Yhoundeh's priests fell out of favor and the people returned to the worship of Tsathoggua.
According to the Parchments of Pnom, Yhoundeh is the wife of Nyarlathotep, messenger of the Outer Gods.

http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/49995/why-do-hastur-cthulhu-hate-each-other
The mi-go visited earth at a time where cthulhu was at war with the elder things. From their travels in space they still held the information about encountering both the elder things and the mythos, and since they had outposts on pluto it would benefit them to join one side or another. This would also give them valuable insight on both races.

The war amazingly ended with a truce where the elder things and the cthulhu split the earth in two parts. Cthulhu then went into hibernation.

Then the unthinkable happened. Humanity evolved and their first nuke told the mi-go that our mental makeup was special. They made experiments and found that humanity had evolved intuition, which bypasses research and observation in huge jumps. This is something that the mi-go want's for themselves, so humanity had to be preserved and the mi-go had to doublecross the mythos.

Cthulhu should have risen for some time, but the mi-go have changed the insides of our moon to control some of the tides on earth, and since the tides control the wakeup sequence of cthulhu, he remains asleep. The mi-go's are also having dimensional dampeners in their lairs that prevent Hastur from manifesting on earth, which is why the brothers of the yellow sign" is at war with the mi-go, trying to torture information out of them (Hard considering their memory deletion capabilities) The mi-go keeps the rest of the mythos at bay by claiming that it would be heresy to let hastur roam the earth without cthulhu, since they are halfbrothers and both hold the birthright to guide the armies of the mythos on earth.



Ghroth
[A] nineteenth century British cult believed in [a] comet-god who sang to the stars and planets as it passed by them in its orbit. They said it destroyed those worlds it passed, by waking up demons or ancient gods ... who slept on each world.
—Kevin A. Ross, "The Music of the Spheres"
Ghroth (the Harbinger) resembles a small, rust-colored planet or moon with a single, gigantic red eye which it can close to avoid detection. Ghroth drifts throughout the universe singing its siren song, the Music of the Spheres. As it swings by a planet, any Great Old One or Outer God sleeping there is awakened by the song. This usually results in the extinction of all life on the planet or perhaps even the utter destruction of the planet itself.[2]
Ghroth is believed to be responsible for the periodic mass extinctions that wiped out 90% of all life on earth, including the extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous era. It may also have caused the destruction of the planet Shaggai, the homeworld of the intelligent, insect-like Shan.[3] For this reason, Ghroth is also known as Nemesis, or the Death Star, named after the Nemesis Hypothesis, first proposed by American astronomers David Raup and Jack Sepkoski.

The Horror Under Warrendown was created by British author Ramsey Campbell for his short story of the same name (1995).
The Horror, which lives under Campbell's invented village of Warrendown in Campbell's Severn Valley setting, resembles one of the giant, cephalic statues of Easter Island, the Moai, albeit one completely covered with vegetation. The plants, however, do not grow separately from the statue, but are in fact part of the Horror itself. It can extend vine-like tentacles to capture a victim or to give a communion offering to a worshipper.
The Horror possesses a strange mutagenic ability: Anyone who partakes of its flesh (i.e., the vegetables that grow from its plant-like overgrowth) will eventually transform into a grotesque, rabbit-like mutant. These mutants worship and serve the Horror, and are dedicated to tricking others into joining their cult by offering them fresh vegetables harvested from it.[4]
While the Horror is unnamed in Campbell's story, it was given the name "The Green God" in the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game.
A similar plant-like deity named E'ilor is mentioned in the short story "Correlated Contents" by James Ambuehl. Like the Horror, E'ilor dwells in a large cavern deep beneath a small farming village in the Severn Valley, and possesses vine-like tentacles whic

http://the-demonic-paradise.wikia.com/wiki/Hastur
Hastur's appearance is largely unknown due to him being completely shrouded in a royal yellow cloak. Despite this, he has shown to have the power of shape shifting and can assume many different forms. Most notable of which is a humanoid figure dressed in a royal yellow garb, a form which earned him the title "King in Yellow". Since one of his attributes involves the element of wind, Hastur's manipulation of the wind is vast and terrifying as he is capable of creating devastating hurricanes that can expand throughout an entire continent or even the regions of space.



The Storm God is probably Hastur, who hates his brother Cthulhu, the Drowned God
