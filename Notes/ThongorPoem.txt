Diombar's Song of the Last Battle

As one by one his brothers fell,

he raised the Star Sword high!

He sang the runes to the Lords of Light

—and thunder broke the sky!

Red lighting flashed—drums of thunder crashed—

a rain of fire fell

To sweep the last of the Dragon Kings down

to the smoking pits of hell!
