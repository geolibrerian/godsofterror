The Horn that Wakes the Sleepers
 
 
Sam is going to blow the Horn of Joramun from Horn Hill, and wake the sleepers who are imprisoned in the Wall. 

[This is the full Night's Watch oath](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_48)

>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
