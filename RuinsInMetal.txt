[The Gods of Terror theory](http://godsofterror.tumblr.com/tagged/godsofterror), in a nutshell, is that Terros is a world located in the literary universe of the Cthulhu Mythos. The Gods of Terror are the ancient gods of Lovecraftian horror who spawned the civilizations of man. These gods are at war with each other, and humans are caught in-between, although they have the power to fight against the spawn of the gods. The spawn are the Deep Ones, although in Terros they are called squishers or merlings or selkies, among many names.

The histories of a Song of Ice and Fire, and the magic of Terros, [take on new and terrible meanings within the framework of the Cthulhu Mythos.](http://godsofterror.tumblr.com/post/148953625721/terrible-gods) 

But also, some of the long-standing mysteries of the stories make so much more sense! **And I think I've solved a long-standing mystery about the books, [with a little help from George RR Martin himself.](http://grrm.livejournal.com/140797.html)**

This mystery is about the bronze armor of [House Royce, First Men of the Vale. Their words are: "We Remember".](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Royce)

The armor is thousands of years old (some dispute that), but none dispute that it is covered in ancient runes that are suppose to ward the wearer from harm. Bronze Yohn Royce has the armor in the current story.

**Enter GRRM:**

>"You could have twenty good hands," said Tyrion. He did not even look up from his book. "The tentacles would catch you and pull you apart like a wishbone." He turned another page. "You had best start reading, if you ever want to fuck our sweet sister again."

>Jaime started reading. It was not at all his favorite pastime, but he saw his little brother's point.

>The better part of an hour passed before he looked up. **"Here's something," he said. "Elder signs."** He turned the book around and showed it to Tyrion.

>The dwarf scratched at his nose, considering. **"Hmmm. Yes. Protective wards. Those could be useful."**

>"I can paint one on my shield," said Jaime.

>"On your shield and all over your armor," suggested Tyrion. "But paint can be stripped away too easily. **Have these Elder Signs etched into the metal.**"

>"Agreed." Jaime rose and summoned his armorer and set him to work. "Along my sword as well," he told the man. "Both sides."


That is an excerpt from a curious post by [GRRM on his Not-A-Blog](http://grrm.livejournal.com/140797.html). This post was advertising the Suduvu Cages Matches, a fun series of imagined battles between popular characters that had Jamie matched up with Cthulhu in the second round of the tournement after defeating Hermione in the first round.

While he links to [Suduvu's account of the battle,](http://www.suvudu.com/2010/03/cage-match-2010-round-2-2-cthulhu-versus-15-jaime-lannister.html) he decided to weigh in with his own take. And in this battle, Jamie and Tyrion do research into the Cthulhu Mythos to understand how to defeat the terrible Cthulhu, one of the Great Old Ones.

While they decide that they couldn't defeat Cthulhu, they do uncover a bit of useful information: the Elder Signs, ancient runes that protect the wearer from the Deep Ones. Jamie enscribes the runes into his armor to protect himself in the climax of the story: 

>He was not wrong. When Jaime strode onto the battleground beside the sea, he found more than twenty of them: priests and acolytes with bulging eyes, fish-belly white skin, receding chins, and the odd gill or two. The moment they saw him, they all started chanting, "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn,"and dancing about in a circle, their pale limbs flopping. Their eyes were all on the waves. None of them paid the least bit of attention to Jaime... until he shrugged off his cloak and let it puddle to the ground, **revealing the golden armor beneath, covered over head to heel with Elder Signs.**

>**Then they started shrieking**. Smiling happily, Jaime donned his helm, and unsheathed his longsword. 

>The priests were slow and clumsy, at least on land. None of them were armed, and his blade went through their pale soft flesh like a fishwife's knife through a fresh catch, the Elder Signs along its length brightening with each kill. Green ichor splattered everywhere. Before long the ground was slippery with scales and **webbed hands** and stinking fish innards. No one was chanting anymore. 

>Cthulhu never showed. Jaime hoped it was having a nice dream. Maybe it has a sweet sister too.

Very devious indeed, George. And how very Jamie of you, Jamie.

[The Elder Sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Sign) is a Lovecraft symbol that resembles a rune. When shown to Deep Ones, it wards and protects the bearer from harm. It was often painted on rocks and other objects to ward off these terrible half human/half spawns of Cthulhu and other [Great Old Ones.](http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Old_Ones) 

[The original Lovecraftian symbol is here.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Elder_sign.jpg) This version is the tree or branch

Also, other writers have taken up the Cthulhu Mythos/ Yog-Sothoros universe, specifically August Derleth, the Elder Sign has taken on a new shape, that of a star - usually a five pointed star, [but a seven pointed star has hovered around the Mythos over time](http://www.cthulhulives.org/eldersign/). This form of the Elder Sign is know as the Flaming Star.

*It make me think of the Seven-Pointed Star symbol that Andal warriors would carve into their chests before battle - another ancient Elder Sign, perhaps?*

So, to recap:

 + The Elder Sign was a powerful ward against the Deep Ones according to Lovecraft.
 + The sigil of House Royce is [a bronze shield with iron studs in it, surrounded by ancient runes.] (http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/File:Royce.png)
 + [George calls out the Elder Signs (multiple) as wards against the Deep Ones in his short story.](http://grrm.livejournal.com/140797.html)
 + In the story, Tyrion and Jamie discuss the best way to wear the Elder Signs, and decide on etching it into Jamie's armor.
 + All of the other Lovecraft references that populate Terros make it clear that this world is in the Cthulhu Mythos universe.
 + [My own Gods of Terror Theory, that states that the world was populated with Deep Ones at the Dawn Age.](http://godsofterror.tumblr.com/tagged/godsofterror/chrono)
 + Hints that the Seven-Pointed Star might represent another ancient Elder Sign.

**House Royce Remembers. That's why their sigil has Runes etched in Bronze.**

**They remember wars against the Deep Ones in the Dawn Age, and they are ready for their return. With their sigil carved with Elder Signs, and their bronze armor with more of the ancient runes, they are ready for the next war against the Deep Ones.**
